# Magical Game

Magical Game (name pending) is a arcade-ish, beat-up-em magical experience built for instant action and playability in the Unity Engine, written in C#.

Magical Game is inspired by games such as: Diablo, Path of Exile and Risk of Rain where the player can constantly be expanded upon for the duration of a play-through or (in some cases) until capped with best-in-slot gear.

One of the goals of Magical Game is to make it so that the player has something to immediately enjoy when they start a new game. Mob density needs to be high but never overwhelming as I feel that GGG and Blizzard have been able to find that perfect amount for the player experience.

## How the game works

Magical Game is a 3D top-down Action RPG at its core. The character will be controlled with WASD and the mouse will be used to orient your character so that you can progress. Magical Game is _NOT_ an episodic game; it is arcade in nature so, when the player starts a new run/character, you are immediately thrown into the first area to meet the requirements to proceed stage by stage.
As you kill mobs and gather experience, the player character will level up and the player will be able to select from a list of randomly generated spells that can be manually triggered or are passive to promote progression.

It's another Roguelike :^).
